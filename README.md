# American-Sign-Language-Gesture-Recognazion-System

A Data Mining and Maching Learning Project which is an attempt to recognize 20 widely used American Sign Language (ASL) Gestures.

Step 1: 
Using Mayo Wrist Band, Performed each action 20 times for durationn of 5 Seconds. Wrist band sampled 34 different sensored data at sampling rate of 5Hz.

Step 2:
The process of Data Cleaning and preprocessing performed on the collected data.

Step 3: 
The Transformation of preprocessed data from Time Domain to Frequency domain for Normalizaion.

Step 4: 
Different Data Mining and Machine Learning Algorithm applied with a view to recognization of a ASL Gesture.

Results and Relevant finding is in the report.
